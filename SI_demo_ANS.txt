/* Problem 1 */
Infinite loop
Output would be integer division by 2 (would round down to the nearest integer)

How would you make it so that the loop doesn't result in an infinite loop?
Doesn't do integer division?

ANSWER: Change the condition in the for loop to be total > 0 without the =.
Change total to be a double.

/* Problem 2 */
Not infinite loop
Output would be only one line at the end because if you do a for loop with
no brackets, only the first line directly below the for is considered in the 
loop.

What would cur and sum be in the output?

ANSWER: cur = 5 (not 4! cur is incremented to 5 to fail the last check and 
end the loop), sum = 0+1+2+3+4 = 10

/* Problem 3 */
Infinite loop
Output would be the same line over and over forever.

What would this line be?

ANSWER: "i = 0"

/* Problem 4 */
Not infinite loop
Output would be "curr = 20", "curr = 19", ... , "curr = 0"

/* Problem 5 */
Not infinite loop
There would be no output.
